# 💡Felika Learning Journal
A website documenting my journey learning front-end development. I build it from scratch as part of my Front-End Study using HTML & CSS.

## 📝What I've Learned
My learning focus include:
1. Structure working file neatly. First through file foldering and secondly through HTML Structure. 
2. Learn more about flexbox. Experiment using different Flexbox and their properties.
3. Learn to use CSS grid, specifically grid-template-areas, to create responsive website.
